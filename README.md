# Racetrack Pathfinder

A Python-based project that implements various pathfinding algorithms for a racetrack game. The project includes:

- Multiple heuristic testing implementations
- Track creation and management
- AI racing against human players
- Data structure performance testing

## Features

- Multiple heuristic implementations for pathfinding
- Track creation with checkpoint system
- Real-time visualization of pathfinding
- Performance testing and comparison of different algorithms
- Interactive track creation and editing

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame
- Other dependencies (to be listed in requirements.txt)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required dependencies
3. Run the main application:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

## Project Structure

- `main.py` - Main application entry point
- `heuristicTesting.py` - Implementation of various heuristic algorithms
- `dataStructureTesting.py` - Performance testing of different data structures
- `trackCreatorCheckpoints.py` - Track creation and editing tool
- `RaceAgainstAIv2.py` - AI racing implementation
